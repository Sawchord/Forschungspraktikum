LTCP changelog:

FIXME:
  Weird message sent on receiving FINACK in closed state
  RST packets get acknowledged in some states, leading to an infinite loop of RST->ACK messages to be exchanged
  
FIXED:
  Connecting on already connected Port crashes everything
  Connecting on already connected port gets RST, but connection gets problems because of wrong seqno and ackno
  Bugs in connect
  RST packet send at the end of the FIN sequence
  Seqno incorrect on Handshake
  
UNCOMFIRMED:
  
TODO:
  MSS in options field
  Cleanup the finish states
  SYN with payload do what?
