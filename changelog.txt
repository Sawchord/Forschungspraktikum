LTCP changelog:

FIXME:
  Weird message sent on receiving FINACK in closed state
  Connecting on already connected port gets RST, but connection gets problems because of wrong seqno and ackno
  
FIXED:
  Connecting on already connected Port crashes everything
  Bugs in connect
  RST packet send at the end of the FIN sequence
  Seqno incorrect on Handshake
  
UNCOMFIRMED:
  RST packets get acknowledged in some states, leading to an infinite loop of RST->ACK messages to be exchanged
  
TODO:
  MSS in options field
  Cleanup the finish states
  SYN with payload do what?
